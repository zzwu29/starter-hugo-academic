I'm a master student from [School of Geodesy and Geomatics](http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).
My research interest includes multi-sensor fusion, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), indoor-outdoor seamless positioning, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and sensor calibration.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xingxing Li](http://xxli.users.sgg.whu.edu.cn/author/xxli/) of [GREAT Lab](http://igmas.users.sgg.whu.edu.cn/home) from [School of Geodesy and Geomatics](http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).
